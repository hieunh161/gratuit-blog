#Ecommerce KPIs

4. Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate (CAR)

> CAR = (Total Number of Completed Transactions / Total Number of Shopping Carts) x 100

5. Shopping Cart Conversion Rate (CCR)

> CCR = (Total Conversions / Total Number of Visitors) x 100

6. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) 

It’s the amount you’re spending to sell your product. For example, manufacturing costs, employee wages, overhead costs, etc.

Multiply by 100 for its percentage and further, multiply it by twelve to get the annual churn rate.
